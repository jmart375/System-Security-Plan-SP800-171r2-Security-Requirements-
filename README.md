# System-Security-Plan-SP800-171r2-Security-Requirements-

This deliverable FMJ2 provided an outline of security controls and measures implemented to safeguard Design Worldâ€™s informational system. Which helps to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and resources within the system. FMJ2 provided a thorough description of how all security requirements were implemented or planned to be implemented. The description for each security requirement contained: 

The security requirement number and description 

How the security requirement is being implemented or planned to be implemented  

Any scoping guidance that has been applied (e.g., compensating mitigations(s) in place due to implementation constraints in lieu of the stated requirement).  If the requirement is not applicable to the system, provide a rationale.   

In order to safeguard controlled unclassified information (CUI) within nonfederal systems and organizations, FMJ2 utilized the guidance provided by the NIST 800-171r2 framework. This framework comprises of 14 control families, each of which delineates specific security requirements. In total, the framework includes 110 individual controls spread across these families. FMJ2 leveraged this framework to assess the existing controls, identify the necessary control implementations and determine the controls that were not applicable to their contracted work.
